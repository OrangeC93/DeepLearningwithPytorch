# Real-world data representation with tensors
## Chapter covers
- Representign different types of real world data as PyTorch tensors
- Working with range of data types, image, and medical imaging
- Loading ata from file
- Converting data to tensors
- Shaping tensors to that they can be used as inputs for neural network models
